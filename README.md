## Resource optimization

1) Dynamic scaling of resources - horizontal and vertical scaling: Ensures efficient resource utilization and cost management.

2) Dynamic allocation of network bandwidth: Improves network performance and reduces congestion.

3) Dynamic storage provisioning: Billing based on consumption helps in cost efficiency.

4) Dynamic workload management: Ensures balanced load distribution and efficient resource utilization.

5) Dynamic load balancer for multiple uplinks: Prevents network traffic bottlenecks.

6) Dynamic workload distribution for storage devices: Optimizes storage usage and performance.

7) Dynamic data normalization: Avoids redundant data, improving storage efficiency.

8) Vertical scaling of data processing: Enhances processing power without additional hardware.

9) Dynamic vertical scaling of data within a storage device: Allows flexible scaling as data needs grow.

10) Memory virtualization: Optimizes memory usage across virtual environments.

11) NIC teaming: Ensures high availability and reliability of virtual servers.

12) Broad access (different device cloud device access): Facilitates accessibility from various devices.

13) Dynamic resource pooling: Efficiently manages and utilizes pooled resources.

14) Resource reservation: Prevents conflicts during concurrent access.

15) Hypervisor clustering: Ensures hypervisor reliability and prevents failures.

16) Redundant cloud data storage: Provides data reliability and fault tolerance.

17) Automated notification (failure) and recovery: Ensures quick response to failures.

18) Multipath resource access: Ensures resource availability if predefined paths fail.

19) Redundant physical connection for virtual servers: Maintains connectivity in case of physical connection failure.

20) Synchronized operating state (using heartbeat agents): Monitors system health and synchronizes operations.

21) Virtual server fault tolerance (zero downtime): Ensures continuous operation.

22) Storage maintenance window: Prevents service disruptions during maintenance.

23) Virtual server auto crash recovery: Minimizes downtime and ensures quick recovery.

24) Non-disruptive service relocation: Ensures service continuity during relocations.

25) Direct I/O access: Enhances performance by reducing latency.

26) Direct LUN access: Improves storage performance.

27) Single root I/O virtualization: Enhances I/O efficiency.

28) Cloud storage data: Encryption, lifecycle management, data management, compliance check, device masking, path masking, performance enforcement â€“ all critical for data security and management.

29) Virtual disk splitting, Sub LUN tiering: Optimizes storage usage.

30) RAID-based data placement: Provides data redundancy and reliability.

31) IP storage isolation: Enhances data security.

32) Virtual server folder migration: Ensures flexibility and mobility of virtual environments.

33) Persistent virtual network configuration: Maintains network settings across reboots.

34) Virtual server connectivity isolation: Ensures security and isolation of virtual servers.

35) External virtual server accessibility: Provides access to external networks.

36) Cross-hypervisor workload mobility: Ensures flexibility and workload mobility.

37) Virtual server to host affinity: Optimizes performance by placing virtual servers close to their required resources.

38) Virtual server to virtual server anti-affinity: Prevents resource contention by separating virtual servers.

39) Stateless hypervisor: Simplifies management and improves scalability.

other problems are considered miscellenous and should be handled depending on requirements.
